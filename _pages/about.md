I am a postdoctoral research associate at [Center for Mechanisms of Evolution](https://biodesign.asu.edu/mechanisms-evolution), [The Biodesign Institute](https://biodesign.asu.edu/), [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/). I am an evolutionary biologist using both computational and experimental approaches. With the emphasis on microbial models, I am particularly interested in studying the factors affecting evolutionary outcomes and the evolution of these factors, including (but not limited to) mutation rates, mutational effects, robustness, and plasticity.
