I am an assistant professor in the Department of Biology at The University of Texas at Tyler. My research program integrates genetics, genomics, evolution, microbiology, and bioinformatics. I am using theoretical, computational, and experimental approaches, with the emphasis on multiple levels of omics and experimental evolution in microbial models. Currently, I am particularly studying the evolution of microbes in considering population-genetic factors and changing environments. The topics include mutation rates, mutational effects, genetic drift, selection, robustness (canalization), plasticity, correlated evolution, etc. I am also interested in studying fitness-related microbial traits and identifying the underlying molecular mechanisms, such as growth curves, metabolism, biofilm formation, and antibiotic resistance.
