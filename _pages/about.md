I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Biology](https://www.uttyler.edu/biology/) at [the University of Texas at Tyler](https://www.uttyler.edu/). My research program integrates genetics, genomics, evolution, microbiology, and bioinformatics. Theoretical, computational, and experimental approaches are used, with emphases on multiple levels of omics and experimental evolution in microorganisms. Currently, I am particularly studying microbial genetics and evolution in considering population-level diversity and environmental changes. The topics include mutation (rates & effects), genetic drift, selection, robustness (canalization), plasticity, correlated evolution, etc. I am also interested in identifying the underlying molecular mechanisms for fitness-related microbial traits, such as growth curves, metabolism, biofilm formation, and antibiotic resistance.
