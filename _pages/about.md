We are the lab of microbial genetics and evolution in the [Department of Biology](https://www.uttyler.edu/academics/colleges-schools/arts-sciences/departments/biology/) at [the University of Texas at Tyler](https://www.uttyler.edu/). We study the relationship between genotypes, phenotypes, and fitness of microorgnisms for understanding their diversity. The research program integrates genetics, genomics, evolution, microbiology, and bioinformatics. Theoretical, computational, and experimental approaches are used, with emphases on multiple levels of omics and experimental evolution. The current focuses in the lab include mutation (rates & effects), genetic drift, selection, robustness (canalization), plasticity, correlated evolution, and etc. In addition, we are interested in discovering the molecular and cellular mechanisms shaping fitness-related traits, such as growth curves, metabolism, biofilm formation, and antibiotic resistance.
