I am a postdoctoral research associate at Center for Mechanisms of Evolution, The Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University. I am an evolutionary biologist, and I am particularly interested in studying the factors affecting evolutionary outcomes and the evolution of these factors, including (but not limited to) mutation rates, mutational effects, robustness, and plasticity.
