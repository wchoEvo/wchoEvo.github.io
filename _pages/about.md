I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Biology](https://www.uttyler.edu/biology/) at [the University of Texas at Tyler](https://www.uttyler.edu/). My research program integrates genetics, genomics, evolution, microbiology, and bioinformatics. Theoretical, computational, and experimental approaches are used, with emphases on multiple levels of omics and experimental evolution in microorganisms. Currently, I am particularly focues on microbial genetics and evolution, considering population-genetic forces and environmental changes. The topics include mutation (rates & effects), genetic drift, selection, robustness (canalization), plasticity, correlated evolution, etc. In addition, I am interested in discovering the relationship between fitness and traits as well as identifying the molecular mechanisms shaping fitness-related traits, such as growth curves, metabolism, biofilm formation, and antibiotic resistance.
