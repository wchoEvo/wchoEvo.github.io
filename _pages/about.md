I am a postdoctoral research associate at [Center for Mechanisms of Evolution](https://biodesign.asu.edu/mechanisms-evolution), [The Biodesign Institute](https://biodesign.asu.edu/), [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/). My research program integrate genetics, genomics, evolution, microbiology, and bioinformatics. I am using theoretical, computational, and experimental approaches, with the emphasis on multiple levels of omics in microbial models. Currently I am particularly interested in studying the factors affecting evolutionary outcomes and the evolution of these factors, including (but not limited to) mutation rates, mutational effects, robustness (canalization), and plasticity.
